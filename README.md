#### Other / Latest (pre)Release
It can take a bit to get latest releases approved on some webstores (looking at you Google), so the latest patches and releases can be installed manually. On the right sidebar you will find the [Releases](https://github.com/RVRX/grailed-plus/releases) section. Download and extract the latest release `grailed_plus-X.X.X.zip`, and follow your browser's extension installation documentation from there.
